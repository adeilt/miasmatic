# Miasmatic <img src="https://github.com/adeilt/miasmatic/blob/master/src/icons/48.png?raw=true">

A Chrome extension to highlight Steam tags I like and don't like.

## Usage

Use Ctrl-clicks to classify tags; Ctrl-left-click means you like the tag and Ctrl-right-click means you dislike the tag. Alt-left-click will remove a like/dislike classification from a tag.

## A hazy view of one possible future

Possible future features I'm considering:

- surfacing other game attributes that are important to me and my friends (e.g. online co-op, some DRM systems, early access status, release date, etc.) so that the information is all in one easy-to-scan box
- searching the text of the reviews that show up on the page for certain keywords
- searching the discussions for the game for certain keywords
